kmeans	1	Red	15	CD274	9606.ENSP00000370989	Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1; Plays a critical role in induction and maintenance of immune tolerance to self. As a ligand for the inhibitory receptor PDCD1/PD-1, modulates the activation threshold of T-cells and limits T-cell effector response. Through a yet unknown activating receptor, may costimulate T-cell subsets that predominantly produce interleukin-10 (IL10).
kmeans	1	Red	15	CD28	9606.ENSP00000324890	T-cell-specific surface glycoprotein CD28; Involved in T-cell activation, the induction of cell proliferation and cytokine production and promotion of T-cell survival. Enhances the production of IL4 and IL10 in T-cells in conjunction with TCR/CD3 ligation and CD40L costimulation. Isoform 3 enhances CD40L-mediated activation of NF-kappa-B and kinases MAPK8 and PAK2 in T-cells.
kmeans	1	Red	15	CD80	9606.ENSP00000264246	T-lymphocyte activation antigen CD80; Involved in the costimulatory signal essential for T- lymphocyte activation. T-cell proliferation and cytokine production is induced by the binding of CD28, binding to CTLA-4 has opposite effects and inhibits T-cell activation.
kmeans	1	Red	15	CD86	9606.ENSP00000332049	T-lymphocyte activation antigen CD86; Receptor involved in the costimulatory signal essential for T-lymphocyte proliferation and interleukin-2 production, by binding CD28 or CTLA-4. May play a critical role in the early events of T-cell activation and costimulation of naive T-cells, such as deciding between immunity and anergy that is made by T-cells within 24 hours after activation. Isoform 2 interferes with the formation of CD86 clusters, and thus acts as a negative regulator of T-cell activation.
kmeans	1	Red	15	CTLA4	9606.ENSP00000497102	Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte protein 4; Inhibitory receptor acting as a major negative regulator of T-cell responses.

kmeans	1	Red	15	ICOS	9606.ENSP00000319476	Inducible T-cell costimulator; Enhances all basic T-cell responses to a foreign antigen, namely proliferation, secretion of lymphokines, up-regulation of molecules that mediate cell-cell interaction, and effective help for antibody secretion by B-cells. Essential both for efficient interaction between T and B-cells and for normal antibody responses to T-cell dependent antigens. Does not up-regulate the production of interleukin- 2, but superinduces the synthesis of interleukin-10. Prevents the apoptosis of pre-activated T-cells. Plays a critical role in CD40- mediated class switching o [...]

Following TCR engagement, LAG3 associates with CD3-TCR in the immunological synapse and directly inhibits T-cell activation (By similarity). May inhibit antigen-specific T-cell activation in synergy with PDCD1/PD-1, possibly by acting as a coreceptor for PDCD1/P [...] 
kmeans	1	Red	15	LGALS9	9606.ENSP00000378856	Galectin-9; Binds galactosides. Has high affinity for the Forssman pentasaccharide. Ligand for HAVCR2/TIM3. Binding to HAVCR2 induces T-helper type 1 lymphocyte (Th1) death. Also stimulates bactericidal activity in infected macrophages by causing macrophage activation and IL1B secretion which restricts intracellular bacterial growth (By similarity). Ligand for P4HB; the interaction retains P4HB at the cell surface of Th2 T-helper cells, increasing disulfide reductase activity at the plasma membrane, altering the plasma membrane redox state and enhancing cell migration. Ligand for CD44; [...] 
kmeans	1	Red	15	LGALS9B	9606.ENSP00000315564	Galectin-9B; Binds galactosides.

kmeans	1	Red	15	MTUS1	9606.ENSP00000262102	Microtubule-associated tumor suppressor 1; Cooperates with AGTR2 to inhibit ERK2 activation and cell proliferation. May be required for AGTR2 cell surface expression. Together with PTPN6, induces UBE2V2 expression upon angiotensin-II stimulation. Isoform 1 inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation, delays the progression of mitosis by prolonging metaphase and reduces tumor growth.
kmeans	1	Red	15	PDCD1	9606.ENSP00000335062	Programmed cell death protein 1; Inhibitory receptor on antigen activated T-cells that plays a critical role in induction and maintenance of immune tolerance to self. Delivers inhibitory signals upon binding to ligands CD274/PDCD1L1 and CD273/PDCD1LG2. Following T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement, PDCD1 associates with CD3-TCR in the immunological synapse and directly inhibits T-cell activation (By similarity). Suppresses T-cell activation through the recruitment of PTPN11/SHP-2: following ligand-binding, PDCD1 is phosphorylated within the ITSM motif, leading to the recruitment of the pr [...] 
kmeans	1	Red	15	PDCD1LG2	9606.ENSP00000380855	Programmed cell death 1 ligand 2; Involved in the costimulatory signal, essential for T-cell proliferation and IFNG production in a PDCD1-independent manner. Interaction with PDCD1 inhibits T-cell proliferation by blocking cell cycle progression and cytokine production (By similarity).
kmeans	1	Red	15	PTPN11	9606.ENSP00000489597	Tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 11; Acts downstream of various receptor and cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases to participate in the signal transduction from the cell surface to the nucleus. Positively regulates MAPK signal transduction pathway. Dephosphorylates GAB1, ARHGAP35 and EGFR. Dephosphorylates ROCK2 at 'Tyr-722' resulting in stimulatation of its RhoA binding activity. Dephosphorylates CDC73.
kmeans	1	Red	15	PTPN6	9606.ENSP00000391592	Tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 6; Modulates signaling by tyrosine phosphorylated cell surface receptors such as KIT and the EGF receptor/EGFR. The SH2 regions may interact with other cellular components to modulate its own phosphatase activity against interacting substrates. Together with MTUS1, induces UBE2V2 expression upon angiotensin II stimulation. Plays a key role in hematopoiesis.
