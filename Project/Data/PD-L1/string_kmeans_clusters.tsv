May interact in cis (on the same cell) or in trans (on other cells) with TNFRSF14. In cis interactions, appears to play an immune regulatory role inhibiting in trans interactions in naive T cells to maintain a resting state. In trans interactions, can predominate during adaptive immune response to provide survival signals to effector T cells.
kmeans	1	Red	10	CD274	9606.ENSP00000370989	Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1; Plays a critical role in induction and maintenance of immune tolerance to self. As a ligand for the inhibitory receptor PDCD1/PD-1, modulates the activation threshold of T-cells and limits T-cell effector response.

kmeans	1	Red	10	IGHV3-43D	9606.ENSP00000481152	Immunoglobulin heavy variable 3-43D; V region of the variable domain of immunoglobulin heavy chains that participates in the antigen recognition. Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are membrane-bound or secreted glycoproteins produced by B lymphocytes. In the recognition phase of humoral immunity, the membrane-bound immunoglobulins serve as receptors which, upon binding of a specific antigen, trigger the clonal expansion and differentiation of B lymphocytes into immunoglobulins- secreting plasma cells. Secreted immunoglobulins mediate the effector phase of humoral immunity, whi [...]

kmeans	1	Red	10	PDCD1	9606.ENSP00000335062	Programmed cell death protein 1; Inhibitory receptor on antigen activated T-cells that plays a critical role in induction and maintenance of immune tolerance to self. Delivers inhibitory signals upon binding to ligands CD274/PDCD1L1 and CD273/PDCD1LG2. Following T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement, PDCD1 associates with CD3-TCR in the immunological synapse and directly inhibits T-cell activation (By similarity). Suppresses T-cell activation through the recruitment of PTPN11/SHP-2: following ligand-binding, PDCD1 is phosphorylated within the ITSM motif, leading to the recruitment of the pr [...] 
kmeans	1	Red	10	STAT3	9606.ENSP00000264657	Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; Signal transducer and transcription activator that mediates cellular responses to interleukins, KITLG/SCF, LEP and other growth factors.

kmeans	1	Red	10	TIGIT	9606.ENSP00000419085	T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains; Binds with high affinity to the poliovirus receptor (PVR) which causes increased secretion of IL10 and decreased secretion of IL12B and suppresses T-cell activation by promoting the generation of mature immunoregulatory dendritic cells.
kmeans	2	Green	9	CD86	9606.ENSP00000332049	T-lymphocyte activation antigen CD86; Receptor involved in the costimulatory signal essential for T-lymphocyte proliferation and interleukin-2 production, by binding CD28 or CTLA-4. May play a critical role in the early events of T-cell activation and costimulation of naive T-cells, such as deciding between immunity and anergy that is made by T-cells within 24 hours after activation. Isoform 2 interferes with the formation of CD86 clusters, and thus acts as a negative regulator of T-cell activation.
kmeans	2	Green	9	CTLA4	9606.ENSP00000497102	Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte protein 4; Inhibitory receptor acting as a major negative regulator of T-cell responses.

Involved in the peripheral immune tolerance, contributing to maintain homeostasis by preventing autoimmunity or immunopathology that would result from uncontrolled and overreacting immune responses. Tryptophan shortage inhibits T lymphocytes division and accumulation of tryptophan catabolites induces T-cell apoptosis and differentiation of regulatory T-cells. Acts as a suppressor of anti-tumor immunity. Limits the growth of int [...]
